## Model Response
### Diseases exercise can help control
Regular physical activity reduces the risk and helps manage conditions such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, depression, and hypertension.

### How exercise combats those diseases
Exercise improves heart efficiency and circulation, enhances insulin sensitivity and glucose control, promotes weight and fat reduction, strengthens muscles and bones, lowers blood pressure and cholesterol, and supports mental health by reducing stress and improving mood.

### Indicated exercises for these conditions
- Cardiovascular disease & hypertension → Aerobic activities (walking, cycling, swimming), moderate resistance training.  
- Type 2 diabetes & obesity → Combination of aerobic exercise + resistance training (to improve insulin sensitivity and aid fat loss).  
- Osteoporosis → Weight-bearing exercises (walking, light jogging), resistance training, balance activities (yoga, tai chi).  
- Depression & anxiety → Aerobic exercise (running, dancing), mind–body practices (yoga, tai chi), group fitness for social engagement.
