# Prompt Basics – Clear and Simple Instructions

## Objective
This project demonstrates how the clarity and structure of a prompt can dramatically change the quality of an AI model’s response. As a Prompt Engineer, the goal is not just to ask questions, but to design effective instructions that deliver actionable and reliable results.

## Example 1 – Vague Prompt
**Prompt:**  
Tell me about how exercise can improve health?

**Model used:** GPT-5  

**Model Response (excerpt):**
- Covered physical, mental, and lifestyle benefits in a long text.  
- Provided interesting points (cardio health, mood, sleep, longevity), but in a broad and unfocused way.  
- Hard to extract immediate, structured insights from the response.

**Issue:** While the answer was correct, it lacked structure, conciseness, and usability for practical contexts (like an article, a health post, or a presentation).

## Example 2 – Clear Prompt
**Prompt:**  
Write a concise overview of how exercise can improve health in 3 bullet points, covering:  
1. What diseases can exercises help to control  
2. How exercises can help combat those diseases  
3. What exercises are indicated for people in those conditions  
In the end, write the references.

**Model used:** GPT-5  

**Model Response (excerpt):**
- Diseases exercise can help control: cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, depression, hypertension.  
- How exercise helps: improves circulation, lowers blood pressure, enhances insulin sensitivity, strengthens muscles and bones, supports mental health.  
- Indicated exercises: aerobic training, resistance training, weight-bearing activities, yoga, tai chi.  
- Included references from AHA, WHO, ADA, and NIH.

**Result:** Clear, concise, and structured. The output became directly usable as material for education, coaching, or content creation.

## Key Takeaways
- Clarity = Quality → a vague request leads to a vague answer.  
- Effective prompts define: format, scope, and length.  
- Even small improvements in wording can make outputs professional-grade.  

## Repository Structure
- simple_prompt.md → vague prompt + model response.  
- improved_prompt.md → structured prompt + model response.  
- README.md → explanation of the case and main insights.

## Next Steps
This was the first project of the Prompt Engineering Portfolio. Upcoming projects will cover few-shot prompting, chain of thought, self-refinement, and more practical use cases for business and fitness applications.
