Act like a social media specialist, then, suggest 2 ways to grow followers on Instagram.

**Model Response (excerpt):**

*Initial strategies:*  
1. **Content Strategy:** Consistency + Value  
2. **Community Building:** Engagement + Collaboration  

*Critique Table:*

| Strategy       | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Content        | Proven framework, aligns with algorithm, encourages consistent posting | Still generic, lacks specifics for fitness niche |
| Community      | Builds trust, expands reach through partnerships | Depends on collaborations, harder to scale |

*Refined Strategy (Content – tailored for Move with Matt):*  
- **Posting Frequency & Formats**: 4x/week →  
  - 2 Reels: quick workout tips (“3 core exercises in 10 minutes”).  
  - 1 Carousel: mini-guides (“5 stretches for lower back pain”).  
  - 1 Story Series: behind-the-scenes + Q&A.  
- **Value Pillars**: education (myths, form tips), motivation (testimonials), lifestyle (balance, travel), personal (your story).  
- **Boost Reach**: SEO captions, niche hashtags (#fitover30, #workoutanywhere), trending audio in fitness context.  
- **CTA**: “Save this workout 💪” / “DM MOVE for a free 7-day plan.”  

✅ The refinement evolved a generic growth tip into a clear, niche-specific content strategy tailored for the "Move with Matt" fitness brand.
