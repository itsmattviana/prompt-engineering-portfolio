# Project 1.4 â€“ Auto-refinement (Self-critique)

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use GPT-5 for self-refinement, where the model generates an initial answer, critiques its own output, and improves it. This technique helps produce more polished, professional, and actionable results.

## Files
- `basic.md`: Contains a simple example of self-refinement on a short text.
- `advanced.md`: Contains a refined version applied to the "Move with Matt" fitness brand.

## WHY IT MATTERS
Self-refinement is important because it forces the model to step back, review, and improve its own work.  
This reduces generic output, corrects mistakes, and makes results more aligned with professional or real-world needs.  
It transforms average answers into clear, actionable, and higher-quality responses.
