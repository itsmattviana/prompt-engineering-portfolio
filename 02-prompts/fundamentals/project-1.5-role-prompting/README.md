# Project 1.5 – Role Prompting (Persona Mode)

## Overview
This project demonstrates how defining a role for the model can drastically improve the quality, clarity, and depth of responses. Instead of just asking a generic question, you can specify *who* the model should act as (e.g., doctor, teacher, travel guide, financial planner). This technique helps align responses with your expectations.

## Files
- `basic.md`: Contains a simple prompt without any role definition.
- `advanced.md`: Contains an improved version where a role is defined to enhance the response.

## WHY IT MATTERS
Role prompting matters because it provides **context and authority** to the model’s answers.  
When GPT-5 acts as a professional or persona, the output becomes more structured, credible, and relevant.  
This technique is especially valuable in business, consulting, planning, and creative scenarios.
