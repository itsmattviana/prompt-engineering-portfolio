# Project 1.3 – Step-by-Step Prompting (GPT-5)

This project demonstrates how step-by-step instructions improve structure and usefulness in GPT-5 outputs. The example is a road trip plan from Madrid to Barcelona, where we impose constraints (daily driving limits, tourist stops, hotels, costs, and total time).

## Files
- `step_by_step.md` — initial simple prompt and GPT-5’s response (broad).
- `improved_step_by_step.md` — refined prompt with clear step-by-step constraints and GPT-5’s response (structured).

## Why this matters
- Step-by-step prompting breaks a complex task into smaller decisions.
- It increases consistency and auditability (you can see how the model reached the final plan).
- Especially useful for planning, logistics, multi-step reasoning, and trade-off analysis.
