# 4.3 – Translation & Cultural Adaptation

## Objective
This project demonstrates how to turn **generic translation requests** into **structured, culturally adapted systems** using prompt engineering.  
We compare a **Basic Prompt** (literal translation + small adjustment) with an **Advanced Prompt** (tones, idioms, regional variants, cultural notes, tables, references, and educational outputs).

## Key Takeaways
- Basic prompts → provide direct translations but often miss **idiomatic nuance**, cultural relevance, and audience adaptation.  
- Advanced prompts → add role definition, multiple tones (original, extra-friendly, chilled), regional variations (Spain, Chile, Argentina, Colombia), comparative tables, cultural analysis, **APA references**, and even **two educational presentations** (students vs. teaching staff).  
- Outputs become **ready-to-use deliverables** for education, marketing, and cross-cultural communication.

## Repository Structure
- `basic.md` → simple translation prompt + model response.  
- `advanced.md` → structured translation/adaptation prompt + multi-section model response.  
- `README.md` → explanation, key insights, and repository organization.
