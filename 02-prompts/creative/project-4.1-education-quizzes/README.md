# 4.1 – Education Quizzes

## Objective
This project demonstrates how to transform health and fitness knowledge into **interactive educational quizzes** using prompt engineering.  
We compare a **Basic Prompt** (simple quiz generation) with an **Advanced Prompt** (structured, multi-level quizzes with graphics, scenarios, and explanations).  

## Key Takeaways
- Basic prompts → generate simple quizzes, but lack depth and engagement.  
- Advanced prompts → add structure: difficulty levels, ASCII graphics, scenarios, correct answers, and explanations.  
- Outputs become **ready-to-use modules** for e-learning, fitness apps, and gamified training.  

## Repository Structure
- `basic.md` → simple quiz + model response.  
- `advanced.md` → structured quiz system with rules, answers, and explanations.  
- `README.md` → explanation, key insights, and repository organization.
