# 4.2 – AI Coach

## Objective
This project demonstrates how to turn generic coaching requests into **structured, actionable coaching systems** using prompt engineering.  
We compare a **Basic Prompt** (general advice) with an **Advanced Prompt** (diagnosis, plans, assets, and decision checkpoints).

## Key Takeaways
- Basic prompts → generate broad tips but lack personalization, metrics, and execution structure.  
- Advanced prompts → add role definition, discovery questions, two-week plan, daily cadence, assets (portfolio draft), data tables/charts, and executive references.  
- Outputs become **ready-to-use coaching deliverables** for solo entrepreneurs and client work.

## Repository Structure
- `basic.md` → simple prompt + model response.  
- `advanced.md` → structured coaching prompt + multi-section model response.  
- `README.md` → explanation, key insights, and repository organization.
