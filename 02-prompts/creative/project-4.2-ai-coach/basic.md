Perfect, Matheus — let’s treat this like coaching sessions where I’ll give you clear, step-by-step advice to improve online sales. I’ll cover foundations, strategy, and practical moves you can apply right away.

📈 Online Sales Coaching

1. Define Your Sales Funnel  
Think of your funnel as the customer’s journey:  
Awareness → people discover you (ads, posts, SEO).  
Interest → they check your page or site.  
Decision → they consider buying (testimonials, offers, guarantees).  
Action → they buy, subscribe, or book.  
👉 Action step: Write down how your funnel looks today. Where do people first see you? Where do you close?

2. Build Trust Before Selling  
People rarely buy from someone they don’t trust.  
Social proof: testimonials, reviews, client results.  
Personal brand: show your face, your story, your values.  
Consistency: same message across Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, email.  
👉 Action step: Collect 3 testimonials (even from friends you’ve helped) and put them on your sales page or social media.

3. Master Your Offer  
A weak offer kills sales. Strong offers highlight:  
Transformation (not features) → “Lose 5kg in 8 weeks” is stronger than “8 training sessions.”  
Scarcity/urgency → limited spots, bonus until Sunday.  
Guarantee → refund policy, free trial, “try risk-free.”  
👉 Action step: Rewrite your offer so it clearly says: what result, in how much time, with how much effort.

4. Learn Copywriting & Storytelling  
Your sales message should answer:  
What problem do I solve? Why me? Why now?  
Formula: Hook → Story → Solution → Call to Action.  
👉 Action step: Write one sales post following this formula.

5. Traffic Strategy (How People Find You)  
You need consistent traffic:  
Organic → TikTok/Instagram Reels, LinkedIn posts.  
Paid → Meta Ads (great for testing offers fast).  
Partnerships → collabs, influencers, guest content.  
👉 Action step: Pick ONE main traffic channel (e.g., Instagram Reels) and commit to posting 3x/week.

6. Follow Up Like a Pro  
Most sales happen in the follow-up.  
Use email sequences or DM nurturing.  
Share extra value (free tips, case studies).  
Gently remind people to take action.  
👉 Action step: Create 3 follow-up messages you can use for warm leads.

7. Track & Improve  
What gets measured improves:  
Track conversion rate (visits → buys).  
Track cost per lead if using ads.  
Ask “Why didn’t you buy?” to improve.  
👉 Action step: Start a simple Excel/Notion sheet with “visitors, leads, buyers” per week.

✅ Your First Homework (Week 1):  
- Map your sales funnel (how clients find you → buy).  
- Collect 3 testimonials and add them online.  
- Rewrite your offer highlighting result + timeframe + effort.  
- Post 1 sales content piece using Hook → Story → Solution → CTA.

**Observation:**  
The guidance is helpful but still **generic**. It lacks a discovery phase tied to your goals, a **two-week plan**, a **daily 5-hour schedule**, **portfolio assets** you can show clients, and **tables/charts** for decisions and projections. It’s hard to execute and measure consistently without that structure.
