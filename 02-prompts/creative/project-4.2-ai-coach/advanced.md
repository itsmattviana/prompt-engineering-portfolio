## Model Response

### 🎯 Goals
Before I design your plan, I need clarity on a few points:

**Primary Objective**  
Do you want to focus on client acquisition (getting paying clients fast), brand awareness (building authority and followers), or a balance of both?

**Target Market**  
Who is your ideal client? (e.g., busy professionals, people wanting fat loss, beginners, expats in Europe, etc.)

**Service Model**  
Do you plan to sell 1:1 coaching, group programs, subscriptions, or hybrid offers?

**Geography & Language**  
Are you focusing globally (English-speaking clients everywhere) or locally (e.g., Malta/Europe in English/Spanish)?

**Short-Term Goal (2–3 months)**  
How many clients or how much monthly revenue would you like to hit?

**Budget & Resources**  
Do you have a budget for ads (Meta/Google) or should we stick to 100% organic growth?
