# 2.3 – Digital Marketing

## Objective
This project demonstrates how prompt engineering can transform generic ad copy into structured, persuasive, and platform-optimized marketing campaigns.  

We compare a **Basic Prompt** with an **Advanced Prompt** for creating ads for the clothing brand **RAZS**, targeting young adults.  

## Key Takeaways
- Basic prompts → generic and broad, not tailored for campaigns.  
- Advanced prompts → define target audience, tone, platform, and structure → directly usable in Facebook/Instagram Ads.  
- Adding **rules** (word limits, tones, stickers for Instagram, references, and expert review) elevates the results to professional-grade.  

## Repository Structure
- `basic.md` → contains the vague prompt + model response.  
- `advanced.md` → contains the improved structured prompt + model response.  
- `README.md` → explanation, key insights, and repository organization.
