# 2.4 – Text Feedback Analysis

## Objective
This project demonstrates how to transform raw customer feedback into structured, actionable business insights using prompt engineering.  
We compare a **Basic Prompt** (broad summary) with an **Advanced Prompt** (structured analysis, visualizations, and executive summary).  

## Key Takeaways
- Basic prompts → generate general summaries, often too broad for decision-making.  
- Advanced prompts → add structure: categorization, justification, themes, tables, charts, and executive insights.  
- Outputs become ready-to-use reports for product, marketing, and C-level strategy.  

## Repository Structure
- `basic.md` → vague prompt + model response.  
- `advanced.md` → structured prompt + detailed business analyst response.  
- `README.md` → explanation, key insights, and repository organization.
