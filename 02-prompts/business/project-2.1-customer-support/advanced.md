# Advanced Example – Customer Support

**Prompt:**
Act like a supportive customer support agent.  
Answer this customer question: "I did not like the trousers, I want a full refund."  

The rules are:  
1. No refund without a reasonable reason.  
2. Keep the tone empathetic but concise, under 100 words.  
3. Give at least three variations (Strict, Friendly, Extra-friendly).  
4. Format each variation as:  
Acknowledgement:  
Policy:  
Alternative:  

**Model Response (excerpt):**

**Strict**  
Acknowledgement: I’m sorry to hear the trousers didn’t meet your expectations.  
Policy: Our refund policy requires a reasonable issue, such as a defect or wrong item received.  
Alternative: While we can’t process a refund in this case, we’d be happy to offer an exchange or store credit so you can pick something you’ll love.  

**Friendly**  
Acknowledgement: Thank you for sharing your feedback—I completely understand how disappointing this can feel.  
Policy: Our policy allows refunds only for reasonable issues like defects or incorrect orders.  
Alternative: We’d love to help you find a better fit! You can exchange the trousers or receive store credit toward another item.  

**Extra-friendly**  
Acknowledgement: I truly appreciate you letting us know, and I’m sorry the trousers weren’t what you hoped for.  
Policy: Our rules don’t allow a full refund unless there’s a product fault or mix-up.  
Alternative: But we want you happy—we’d gladly arrange an exchange, offer store credit, or even help you choose something that suits your style better.  

✅ Compared to the basic version, these responses are empathetic, policy-aligned, and flexible in tone. This makes them more effective for real-world customer support.
