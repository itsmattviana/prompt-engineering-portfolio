# Basic Example – Customer Support

**Prompt:**
Answer this customer question:  
"I did not like the trousers, I want a full refund."  
The rule: no refund without a reasonable reason.

**Model Response (excerpt):**
“Thank you for your feedback. As per our policy, refunds are only processed when there is a reasonable issue with the product, such as a defect or an incorrect item received. Simply not liking the trousers does not fall under this rule. However, we’d be happy to assist you with an exchange or provide store credit if you’d like to choose a different item.”

✅ This response is correct but feels rigid and lacks empathy.
